        abstract = {Detonation waves are a challenging field of study given the short time and length scales involved in the phenomenon. Such waves exhibit a complex structure consisting of a lead shock and shock waves travelling transversely to a detonation?s normal propagation direction. The interaction between the shocks and the rapid chemical reactions they trigger results in the emergence of a natural length scale, the detonation cell size. There are still no complete theory or model that can accurately predict the cell size or a detonation waves initiation, propagation and failure dynamics. The numerical simulation of detonation waves is also challenging, due to the rapid reaction rates encountered. The Open source Field Operation And Manipulation (OpenFOAM) framework, commonly referred to as OpenFOAM, Computational Fluid Mechanics (CFD) package is increasingly used and referenced.
One drawback of the stock OpenFOAM package is that the only finite volume numerical scheme available for the solution of the Euler equations in conservative form is the Kuganov-Tadmor (KT)/Kuganov-Noelle-Petrova (KNP) numerical scheme. Moreover, combustion is not implemented, hence which needs to be modified to simulate detonation waves; a coupling of compressible flows and reaction. This particular scheme is 2nd order accurate in smooth region based on the idea behind the Lax-Friedrichs scheme and which does not involve the solution to a Riemann problem in order to evaluate the intercell fluxes. This is unlike the methods currently used in detonation research, which nearly always consist of Godunov-type schemes with an approximate Riemann Solver such as Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact (HLLC). OpenFOAM, with the KNP scheme, was recently used to simulate
the two-dimensional structure of detonation waves despite having not been fully validated for the detonation simulation. Efforts to get access to the codes used proved abortive. In this work, we create a custom solver named rhoCentralFoamreac which we used to evaluate (validate) the KNP scheme for detonation cases, by simulating a standard 1D detonation
case that usually results in pulsating propagation with a single mode. Metrics for detailed comparison and convergence studies are the oscillation peak pressure and period. Using the KNP scheme, we then examine OpenFoam as a CFD tool for the simulation of a detonation based engine, where an initiated wave propagates circumferentially in a combustion chamber, commonly referred to as a rotating detonation engine. We study the effect of different
ignition methods, and initiation flow fields (subsonic and supersonic) on the formation of these rotating detonation waves.}

abstract = "A new solver developed within the framework of OpenFOAM 2.3.0, called rhoCentralRfFoam which can be interpreted like an evolution of rhoCentralFoam, is presented. Its use, performing numerical simulations on initiation and propagation of planar detonation waves in combustible mixtures H2–Air and H2–O2–Ar, is described. Unsteady one dimensional (1D) Euler equations coupled with sources to take into account chemical activity, are numerically solved using the Kurganov, Noelle and Petrova second order scheme in a domain discretized with finite volumes. The computational code can work with any number of species and its corresponding reactions, but here it was tested with 13 chemically active species (one species inert), and 33 elementary reactions. A gaseous igniter which acts like a shock-tube driver, and powerful enough to generate a strong shock capable of triggering exothermic chemical reactions in fuel mixtures, is used to start planar detonations. The following main aspects of planar detonations are here, treated: induction time of combustible mixtures cited above and required mesh resolutions; convergence of overdriven detonations to Chapman–Jouguet states; detonation structure (ZND model); and the use of reflected shocks to determine induction times experimentally. The rhoCentralRfFoam code was verified comparing numerical results and it was validated, through analytical results and experimental data."

abstract = "Theory and computations have established that thermodynamic gradients created by hot spots in reactive gas mixtures can lead to spontaneous detonation initiation. However, the current laminar theory of the temperature-gradient mechanism for detonation initiation is restricted to idealized physical configurations. Thus, it only predicts conditions for the onset of detonations in quiescent gases, where an isolated hot spot is formed on a timescale shorter than the chemical and acoustic timescales of the gas. In this work, we extend the laminar temperature-gradient mechanism into a statistical model for predicting the detonability of an autoignitive gas experiencing compressible isotropic turbulence fluctuations. Compressible turbulence forms non-monotonic temperature fields with tightly-spaced local minima and maxima that evolve over a range of timescales, including those much larger than chemical and acoustic timescales. We examine the utility of the adapted statistical model through direct numerical simulations of compressible isotropic turbulence in premixed hydrogen-air reactants for a range of conditions. We find strong, but not conclusive, evidence that the model can predict the degree of detonability in an autoignitive gas due to turbulence-induced thermodynamic gradients."

The hydrogen/air and hydrogen/oxygen RDE concepts have been most extensively studied, however, being able to use hydrocarbon fuels is essential for practical RDE’s. The current paper extends our hydrogen/air model to hydrocarbon fuels with both air and pure oxygen as the oxidizer. Before beginning the RDE calculations, several detonation tube results are summarized showing the ability of the code to reproduce the correct detonation velocity and CJ properties. In addition, a calculation capturing the expected irregular detonation cell patterns of ethylene/air is also shown. To do the full range of fuels and oxidizers, we found the use of temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties to be essential, especially for hydrocarbon/oxygen mixtures. The overall results for air-breathing RDE’s with hydrocarbons ranged from 1990 to 2540s, while in pure oxygen mode the specific impulse varied from 700 to 1070s. These results were between 85% and 89% of the expected ideal detonation cycle results, and are in line with previous hydrogen/air estimates from our previous work. We conclude from this that hydrocarbon RDE’s are viable and that the basic flow-field patterns and behaviors are very similar to the hydrogen/air cases detailed previously."

abstract = "Procedures to define boundary conditions for Navier-Stokes equations are discussed. A new formulation using characteristic wave relations through boundaries is derived for the Euler equations and generalized to the Navier-Stokes equations. The emphasis is on deriving boundary conditions compatible with modern non-dissipative algorithms used for direct simulations of turbulent flows. These methods have very low dispersion errors and require precise boundary conditions to avoid numerical instabilities and to control spurious wave reflections at the computational boundaries. The present formulation is an attempt to provide such conditions. Reflecting and non-reflecting boundary condition treatments are presented. Examples of practical implementations for inlet and outlet boundaries as well as slip and no-slip walls are presented. The method applies to subsonic and supersonic flows. It is compared with a reference method based on extrapolation and partial use of Riemann invariants. Test cases described include a ducted shear layer, vortices propagating through boundaries, and Poiseuille flow. Although no mathematical proof of well-posedness is given, the method uses the correct number of boundary conditions required for well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations and the examples reveal that it provides a significant improvement over the reference method."
