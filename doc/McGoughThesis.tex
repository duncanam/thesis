\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% because it is very short
		This thesis contains research performed on detonation modeling in OpenFOAM\cite{weller}, an open-source computational fluid dynamics toolbox. First, solvers are tested for their ability to capture shocks and model reactions as needed for detonations. Adaptive mesh refinement, a type of runtime-active mesh generation that refines the mesh in regions of the domain that need it, is explored to determine if they can model detonations accurately. Additional work is done in determining how tweaking certain adaptive meshing parameters changes the solution to the reacting flow field. Other parameters such as the time step and Arrhenius chemical rate coefficient sensitivity are examined. 

		It was found that good reproduction of detonation waves formed with static computational grids can be done with adaptive meshing routines in OpenFOAM, and certain adaptive meshing parameters will better utilize the cells for detonation reproduction than others.

	\noindent For all the continual support, patience, guidance throughout my work on this thesis, I'd like to thank Dr. Hamlington. I appreciate his willingness to guide me through my Master's degree research, and without it this would not have been possible.

	\noindent In addition, I'd like to thank the students in the Turbulent Energy Systems Laboratory (TESLa): Caelan Lapointe and Colin Towery. Their patience throughout my journey of knowledge through areas they were familiar was admirable. Without their assistance, I would have progressed much more slowly.

	\noindent I'd like to thank my mentor during my early time at SpaceX, Dr. Diego Arias. His guidance and advice led me to pursuing this thesis work throughout my graduate education.

	\noindent Lastly, I'd like to thank those closest to me, my parents Julie and Jeff as well as my dearest Vismaya. Their love and support was invaluable.
