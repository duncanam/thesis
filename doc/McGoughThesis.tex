\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% because it is very short

	Often the abstract will be long enough to require
	more than one page, in which case the macro
	``$\backslash$OnePageChapter'' should {\it not}
	be used.

	But this one isn't, so it should.

	\noindent For all the continual support, patience, guidance throughout my work on this thesis, I'd like to thank Dr. Hamlington. I appreciate his willingness to guide me through my Master's degree research, and without it this would not have been possible. 

	\vspace{0.75cm}

	\noindent In addition, I'd like to thank the students in the Turbulent Energy Systems Laboratory (TESLa): Caelan Lapoint and Colin Towery. Their patience throughout my journey of knowledge through areas they were familiar was admirable. Without their assistance, I would have progressed much more slowly. 

	\vspace{0.75cm}

	\noindent I'd like to thank my mentor during my early time at SpaceX, Dr. Diego Arias. His guidance and advice led me to pursuing this thesis work throughout my graduate education. 

	\vspace{0.75cm}

	\noindent Lastly, I'd like to thank those closest to me, my parents Julie and Jeff as well as my dearest Vismaya. Their love and support was invaluable.
