# Solver Directory Information

There are two directories here containing cases for `rhoReactingCentralFoam` and `rhoReactingFoam`. The `rhoReactingFoam` cases are now depreciated, but kept, for legacy. The `rhoReactingCentralFoam` solver is a combination of `rhoReactingFoam` and `rhoCentralFoam` developed by Caelan Lapointe.
